# Adventure Game Studio Demo Game

This is the very old "Demo Quest" game made for [Adventure Game Studio](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) in the early 2000-ies, with a purpose of demonstrating engine's features.

**WARNING:** very much out of date. Made with 8-bit (paletted) graphics, and contains use of deprecated script API. *NOT* recommended for learning AGS.
