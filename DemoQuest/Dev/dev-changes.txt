-- Cornjob: please do the artwork/code for opening door to media wing in Room 10, or you could just get rid of the door altogether.

- Added the LEC ROOM (door next to SCI0) room number 257
- Used the GUI 5 for the LEC Room

Turn 6 -- 26 FEB -- cornjob:
- Added debug command Ctrl-G, which allows you to examine and alter GlobalInts
- F1 now brings up general help, F10 now brings up educational info wndow
- Added Advanced room (250) and connected Arcade hall to it. No, none of the other stuff in the room does anything yet.
- Added SCI0 room (206). What is the library card for? Don't ask, I have no idea.
- Added GUI0, and some stuff into on_key_press used for SCI0 parser
- Fixed up a couple of things in slot machine. Slot machine now uses the coins (inv item 5) instead of its own money variable.
- Added Looping room (260) to the Advanced room. Also incuded looping.txt, which is info that Kairus originally wrote.
- Added some code for handling the inv item coins into global repeatedly_execute. Somebody tell me if it's needed. It doesn't seem to work otherwise.
- Started adding unhandled_event. Somebody finish it off for me.
- Moved some things out of the global script into their respective rooms. This is to keep the global script relatively uncluttered. (Well, without using too complicated code).

Turn 5 -- 24 FEB -- Spyros:
- Added the Arcade room (255)
- Added a slot machine room (257)
- Fixed a bug when leaving Factory (room 5 not found)

- Disabled cursor cycling in Title Screen (Room 100)
- Started updating messages, hotspots in Rooms 1 - 8 that needed work :)

- Made all filenames caps-consistant and made new 'dev' directory.
- Reformatted some dev files.

Turn 3 -- 20 FEB -- chrille:
- Added Room 12, the racing game room
- Go to racing room through left hallway and entering the "black" door on the left side (to be changed once advanced hallway has been added.)
- Added 8 new characters, all using the driving room
- Added a new sprite folder for the driving room
- Some extra stuff to the "on key press" section
- Known bugs:
- If Toadie crashes, and you leave and enter, he just pops up out of nowhere if you press the start button. (to be fixed on next Chrille turn)
- Whenever the driveby sound plays, the game slows down a bit on my computer (anyone else?) I'll try to fix this the next time it's my turn.

Turn 2 -- 19 FEB -- cornjob:
- Added room 11: The Hall of guis. Not all doors are in place yet. If you need the raw image files for this room or anything I added, just let me know.
- Added money (inventory item 5). This can be picked up from the object on the ground in room 4.
- Added a new character, Toadie (char 3). He's fully animated, but doesn't do anything yet.
- Fixed a few small things in the scripts.

Turn 1 -- 15 FEB -- cornjob:
- I replaced the demo quest title screen with a start/load quit screen. The old "do you want to skip" gui (GUI ) is disabled, but could be used in a future cutscene demonstration.
- I added GUI 7, the gui used to display the educational info on each room. Can be called by pushing F1 or clicking '?' button on menu gui.
- I replaced almost everything that happens after using the key on the door, including the part where the other man walks through the door. For now, he just stays there.
- Added room 10: The Lobby. This is now what is beyond the door. Sorry, this is the only new room I added.
- Moved room 9: the access panel used to be in room 10 instead of where it was before. It now controls the circular door.
- Removed the keycode 'L' that brings up the lucasarts interface. The lucas interface gui should remain where it is for now, since it will be used in a later room. Removed the 'lucasarts_on' global variable.
- I installed an improved script for using the keyboard to walk... you can now stop.
- I made the edges of GUI 3 (used for Display boxes) prettier.
