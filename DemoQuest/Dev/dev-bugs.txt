"BUGS"
======

Give "item" to "hotspot" is not working , it just displays Give "item" (Need Chris's help?)  (SPYROS)

Overall sound volume control does not really act as an overall sound volume control (turn it all down, then leave AGS factory to street)  (RELIGHT)

All inputs (jump to room, save screenshot, etc) should include "cancel" button and also handle bad inputs so it doesn't crash.  (RELIGHT)


FIXED BUGS
==========

Entering advanced room, there is a flicker just before you enter.  Something to do with the palette change no doubt.  (RELIGHT) (fixed -- CJ)

Bug:The cursor's hotspot is not in the center so it's dificult to track some hotspots/objects (fixed using new command ChangeCursorHotspot)  (SPYROS)
